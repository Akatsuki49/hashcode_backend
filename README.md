## Inspiration

readmore.ai is inspired by the staggering number of individuals worldwide diagnosed with learning disabilities, accounting for approximately 15% of the global population. Additionally, it aims to cater to those with ADHD and short attention spans. It is also an incredibly useful tool for providing kids and toddlers with an interesting reading experience.  The idea is to develop a solution that not only enhances the reading experience but also makes it more accessible and engaging for everyone.

## Introduction

readmore.ai is a groundbreaking app designed to revolutionize the reading experience by integrating AI-generated Context-Aware Visuals and Audio. Through advanced AI technologies, the app aims to provide users with an extra incentive to engage with reading material, making it more enjoyable and immersive.

## How It Works

The app's core functionality revolves around enhancing the reading experience with AI-generated visuals and audio. Here's a breakdown of its operation:

1. **User Authentication:**
   - Users can sign up or log in to access the app's features securely.

2. **Book Selection:**
   - Upon logging in, users can explore a curated selection of books available within the app's library.

3. **Reader View:**
   - After selecting a book, users are directed to a reader view, where they can delve into the content paragraph by paragraph.

4. **AI Integration:**
   - When a user selects a paragraph, a POST request is sent to the Flask backend, leveraging the GPT-3.5 API to generate prompts for both image and audio models.
   - These prompts are then utilized to generate context-aware visuals and audio corresponding to the selected paragraph using AI models such as "dreamlike light" for images and "musicgen" for audio.

5. **Rendering Content:**
   - The generated visuals and audio are asynchronously rendered in the app, enhancing the reading experience and providing users with a multi-sensory engagement.

6. **Consistency with Seeding:**
   - To ensure consistency within the generated content for the same story, seeding techniques are implemented, providing users with a cohesive reading experience.

## Features
